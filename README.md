# Analyzing-and-visualizing-GPX-data

Code for analyzing and visualizing data from my GPS watch. So far looked at time spent in heart rate zones. Going forward I think that it can be a basis for more complicated analyzes. For example, to classify the type of workout or something similar. Could also be interesting to get the data directly from Strava.
